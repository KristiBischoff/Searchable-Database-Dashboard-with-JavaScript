### Objective

The client is interested in identifying data on UFO sightings and would like a website that has a searchable table/database that presents data on UFO sighting(s) conditioned on search criteria. The objective was to develop a website that dynamically produces a table with each UFO sighting. Next, the code needed to have a filter search with a response based on the search criteria. Any user can search by date, city, state, country, or shape. Only HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and D3.js were used.
